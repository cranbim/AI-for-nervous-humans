## Notes from the AI for Nervous Humans workshop at Bath Digital Festival on 22/10/20
Apologies that soem f the more interactive elements could not be delivered. The 'Webinar' version of Zoom did not allow us to run the open peer to peer style session I had planned.
Here are the slides from the session.
