# AI for Nervous Humans
A workshop on AI for everyone

AI for nervous Humans is a workshop funded by a small grant from the [South West Creative technology Network](https://www.swctn.org.uk/)'s Automation round.

Dave Webb is a creative technologist and artist in digital and new media.

The workshop assumes no technical, maths or data science knowledge. It's for everyone.
During the workshop you will learn
- What AI is (and is not)
- What machines and humans are each good at
- What machine learing is and (roughly) how it works
- What you might be excited or worries about, and what can be doen about those worries
- To train and use a simple machine learning algorithm for fun

You only need a laptop.
With current restrictions on in-person events, the workshop will run remotely, but still as hands-on and interactive as we can make it.

### Current workshops available to book.
